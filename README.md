# Networked-MIDI-Controller
This project utilises an ARM assembly implementation of a slightly altered SPI network protocol utilising a secondary data line used to send out a 16-bit message (little endian) on a STM32L47b Discovery Board. The protocol implementation utilizes functions, GPIO interrupts and memory based data structures. Testing the protocol was done by playing the bassline to 2pac’s “Do for Love” using square waves sampling at a 192 kHz rate. As it stands the current implementation is intended bridge a network on the same board with a virtualized send/recieve format. This can be easily changed to involve a secondary board where GPIO interrupt handlers can be aclimated to only sending or recieving.
